# Creating the Bot

1. First, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, and click on, `New Application` at the top right of the screen. Upon clicking on the button, name the application whatever you please.
2. Once you create your application, click on the `Bot` button in the sidebar, and click on `Add Bot`.
3. Upon creating the bot, click on the `copy` button. This is your bot token. DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE. IF THIS KEY IS LEAKED, USERS COULD TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER YOUR BOT.
4. Next, to add the bot to your server, click on the `OAuth2` button, then click on `URL Generator`.
5. You'll then be presented with a checklist. Click on `bot` and `applications.commands`. This will allow the bot's slash commands to function properly.
6.  You'll then be presented with another set of options. While you can select which ever permissions you'd like, in order for the bot to work properly, please activate the following permissions:

    * Use Slash Commands
    * Embed Links
    * Attach Files
    * Send Messages
    * Manage Events
    * Manage Roles
    * Moderate Members

    You can also just select the Administrator permission if you'd like.
7. Finally, copy the generated url which can be found at the bottom of the page, and add the bot to your server.
